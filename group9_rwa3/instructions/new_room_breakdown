Since the world file is now turtlebot3_house.world the room breakdwon is different.
If you looks at the my_map.pgm file you will see the map of the house that was used. We will be breaking the
house into four rooms still, but the rooms will now be grouped since there are six total. 
The new room definitions are as follows:

1) The two left-most rooms - "storagerooms"
2) The large room to the right of "storagerooms" - "livingroom"
3) The two right-most rooms - "recreationrooms"
4) The small room with the trashcan in the corner between rooms "livingroom" and "recreationrooms" - "trashroom"
